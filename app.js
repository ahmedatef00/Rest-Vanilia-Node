 I was asked to draw the ERD of a many to many relation of employee (employee_id,employee_name) and languages (language_id,language_name)
 each employee can speak many languages and each language is spoken by many employees ,
 so I drew an extra table called language-employee with the employee_id and the language_id which has a one too many relation with each the employee and the language .
 then he asked me to write sql query to select the employee name and the language name, I used join


 given an array of integers and a target , find two elements of the array having a sum = target
